<h2 id="id0a">Weather</h2>
<p>Each item is an array of size 365x551 representing the hourly weather
variables from 551 different sites over one standard year in Europe. The
dataset was obtained via the Meteonorm software<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.
The standard year can be regarded as a hypothetical average year and
does not represent actual measurements.</p>
<p>The temperature, relative humidity and precipitation were used to
estimate daily average moisture content variation whereas precipitation,
wind direction and wind speed were used to characterize wind-driven
rain.</p>
<h2 id="id1a">Moisture content (FE model)</h2>
<p>Inputs of temperature, relative humidity and precipitation are used
to calculate the moisture content variation of a sheltered and exposed
board, respectively. Each output item (exposed board/sheltered board) is
an array of 365x551 representing the daily average moisture content
variation at each of the 551 locations. The moisture content was
calculated with a numerical model described in detail by Niklewski and
Fredriksson<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>For each location, the model was run twice. In the first run,
precipitation, temperature, and relative humidity were used as input and
it was assumed that one face of the board became wet during rain events.
The resulting dataset is referred to as the moisture variation of the
exposed board and are described in more detail by Niekerk et al<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. In the second run, precipitation
was instead neglected, and the resulting dataset is thus referred to as
the moisture variation of the sheltered board.</p>
<h2 id="id2a">Moisture content detail
(empirical model)</h2>
<p>Inputs of moisture content (exposed board), precipitation and
temperature are used to calculate the moisture content of five different
details through use of an empirical model. The model has two parameters
describing the mode/rate of water absorption and the level of
ventilation to facilitate drying, respectively. The former was selected
to describe end-grain absorption and side-grain absorption,
respectively, and the latter was selected to describe no ventilation and
limited ventilation, respectively. This results in a total of 4 details.
The fifth type (free end-grain) was described by end-grain absorption
and excellent ventilation. The output is an array of 365x551x6
representing the daily average moisture content variation at each of the
551 locations in six different configurations including the horizontal
board. The model and details are described in detail by Niklewski et
al<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p><img src="./image3.png"
style="width:6.30208in;height:3.16667in" /></p>
<p>Figure 2. The 6 different details included.</p>
<h2 id="id3a">Dose model (AG)</h2>
<p>Inputs of moisture content and temperature are used to calculate
dose. The output is an array of 6x551x7 representing the cumulative dose
over one standard year in six different details and the sheltered case.
A general description of modelling fungal decay through dose models is
given by Isaksson et al<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Note that there are several
different dose models available, however here the <em>simplified
logistic</em> model was used. The motivation is that the <em>logistic
model</em>, while being sounder from a physiological perspective, is not
compatible with the factorized approach. A discussion between the
logistic and simplified logistic models are given by Niklewski et
al<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<h2 id="id5a">Wind-driven rain (empirical
model)</h2>
<p>Inputs of precipitation, wind direction and wind speed were used to
estimate driving rain in different directions. Driving rain was
calculated as follows:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>R</em><sub><em>w</em><em>d</em><em>r</em></sub> = 0.222 * <em>U</em> * <em>R</em><sub><em>h</em></sub> * cos (<em>θ</em>)</span></p>
<p>where R<sub>wdr</sub> (mm/h) is driving rain, U (m/s) is the wind
speed, R<sub>h</sub> [mm/h] is the rain passing through a horizontal
plane and <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span> is the angle
between the normal of the wall surface and the wind direction. The model
is described in detail by Blocken and Carmeliet<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
<p>For each location, driving rain on vertical surfaces was calculated
for wall directions between 0 and 359 degrees, with an interval of 1
degree. The maximum cumulative driving rain for any orientation was then
divided by the to get the exposure to rain relative to the total rain
passing through a horizontal surface.</p>
<p><img src="./image4.png"
style="width:2.72917in;height:1.53629in" /></p>
<p>Figure 3</p>
<p>Horizontal surfaces which are protected by roof structures can be
considered sheltered when the wind direction is favourable. As an
example, consider that the deck illustrated in Figure x is facing south.
In this case, the deck can be considered fully sheltered for wind
directions of S ± 90 degrees. For other wind directions, the outermost
edge of the deck is fully exposed to precipitation. The exposure to rain
in this point relative to the total rain passing through a horizontal
surface was calculated, again considering the most adverse
orientation.</p>
<p><img src="./image5.png"
style="width:2.72917in;height:1.53629in" /></p>
<p>Figure 4</p>
<p>Each output item consists of an array of size 551x1 with relative
exposure to driving rain on horizontal surfaces with roof and vertical
surfaces, respectively.</p>
<h2 id="id7a">Material properties</h2>
<p>Material performance indicators were obtained from a mix of
laboratory and field trials<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a><em>. Material properties
include both a variety of relative moisture dynamics (e.g. long term
absorption) and relative natural resistance to fungal decay.</em></p>
<h2 id="id8a">Resistance model</h2>
<p><em>A resistance model</em><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <em>was used to derive
in-ground and above-ground relative resistance from the material
performance indicators.</em></p>
<h2 id="id6a">Soil conditions (SMAP)</h2>
<p>Data from the SMAP database were used to derive surface water holding
capacity, soil moisture content and surface temperature. SMAP provides
gridded surface data with a spatial resolution of 9x9 km<sup>2</sup>. An
equidistant grid covering Europe and northern Africa were analysed,
including a total of 4814 points.</p>
<h2 id="id9a">Dose model (IG)</h2>
<p>Inputs of surface water holding capacity, soil moisture content and
surface temperature were used to calculate the exposure dose. A dose is
a unitless measure describing the daily rate of fungal development
between 0 (unsuitable) and 1 (ideal). The dose is calculated by
multiplication of the moisture- and temperature-induced dose. The
moisture-induced dose is calculated as a function of water holding
capacity and soil moisture content and the temperature-induced dose is
calculated from the surface temperature. The model is described in
detail by Marais et al<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"

<h2 id="id0c">Weather</h2>
<p>Three different climates, including contemporary and two future
climate scenarios, were used to a model the regional risk of termites.
The dataset was obtained via the Meteonorm software<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.
The contemporary dataset includes 551 locations scattered over Europe.
The standard year can be regarded as a hypothetical average year and
does not represent actual measurements.</p>
<h2 id="id3c">Termite model</h2>
<p>The natural occurrence of termites was determined through Defaut’s
system of photoclimatic stages (DSPS). Based on variations in
temperature and precipitation, each climate was assigned a temperature
class, aridity/humidity category and continentality. It was then assumed
that the natural occurrence of termites is limited to semi-arid,
sub-humid or temperate sub-xeric climates with an average temperature of
the coldest month above 2.5°C. The climate categorization in conjunction
with the criterion for natural occurrence results in a binary dataset of
favourable and unfavourable coordinates. This dataset was then
interpolated to obtain the maps of termite risk. More details are given
by Niekerk et al<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"

<p>Figure 6.</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows the concept used to simulate appearance changes of
wood caused by environmental effects. The kinetic and/or intensity of
such changes depends on structure and architectural design (3D model),
location (weather), microclimate (environmental analysis), and the
materials used for construction (measurements and database). The
relationship linking the various factors to kinetics is the dose model.
The dose model returns the degree of discoloration in different nodes on
the building envelope and the material database holds species-specific
relationships between colour and degree of discoloration. This section
provides a proof-of-concept protocol for integrating the material
database with environmental analysis to visualize the colour change of
wood.</p>
<h2 id="id0b">Weather</h2>
<p>The most important weather variables include precipitation, wind
speed, wind direction and solar radiation. The former three are needed
to calculate the exposure to driving rain.</p>
<h2 id="id4b">3D model</h2>
<p>Geometry is information describing the position of vertices and how
they connect to form lines and faces and objects. A vertex is a single
point in space, defined by its x, y and z-coordinate. Two vertices can
be joined to a line, and a minimum of three lines can be joined to a
face (surface). An object can consist of multiple surfaces. For example,
a box is made up of 8 vertices, 12 lines and 6 faces. A 3D model can
include multiple objects. Figure 1a shows a basic 3d model.</p>
<p>The material determine how object surfaces will be rendered. Real
materials are often visualized by projecting an image of a real material
onto the surface of the object. To project a flat image to an object
consisting of several surfaces facing in different directions (normal),
then the object needs to be unwrapped, or unfolded, onto a 2D plane.
This process is called <a
href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/uv/introduction.html">UV-mapping</a>.
Figure 1b shows the unwrapped surfaces of the basic 3D model. A flat
texture can then be mapped to match the UV-map, whereafter the 3D-shape
is reassembled.</p>
<h3 id="section-2"><img src="./image10.png"
style="width:6.3in;height:1.91042in" /></h3>
<p>Figure 7. A basic 3D geometry (left) with its wall-surfaces unwrapped
onto a flat surface (right).</p>
<p>As an alternative to image textures, procedural material textures can
be generated from algorithms. Like vector-based graphics, procedural
textures are defined by mathematics and the resolution is only limited
by the resulting rendered image. Procedural textures are difficult to
transfer between different computer software. To solve this, a
procedural texture can be pre-rendered and mapped from the object onto a
2D texture image prior to transfer. Figure 2a shows a 3D model with
grayscale procedural textures and Figure 2b shows the same textures
rendered as a texture image. After pre-rendering, the object can easily
be reassembled in a different software from its geometry, the rendered
image, and the texture coordinates. The infinite resolution of the
procedural texture is however lost in the process.</p>

textures projected and baked onto a 3D texture image (right).</p>
<h2 id="id1b">Environmental analysis</h2>
<p>Weather variables contributing to surface deterioration, mainly
wind-driven rain and direct solar radiation, should be simulated in an
environmental analysis and mapped a to an image which can then be
processed and projected onto the 3D-model. In the CLICKdesign project,
several different approaches have been used for environmental analysis.
In cases where accuracy is important it is recommended to perform the
environmental analysis in a software dedicated to numerical simulation
and computational fluid dynamics. However, reduced computational time
can be obtained by modelling precipitation through raytracing or
particle simulations. Figure 3 shows a particle simulation based on the
Blender native physics engine and the corresponding map showing the
exposed surfaces of the building.</p>

<h2 id="id2b">Dose model</h2>
<p>The results from the environmental analysis are used as input to a
dose model to estimate the degree of discoloration in different nodes on
the building envelope. The model used to translate precipitation,
radiation and other effects to deterioration is called a dose model.
Unfortunately, a working dose model is yet to be developed. Therefore, a
CLICKdesign has used various simple criteria in lieu of an actual dose
model. For a simplified analysis, it can be assumed that any surface
which is exposed to both precipitation and solar radiation eventually
becomes fully weathered. This does not take into consideration the
kinetics of the degradation process but is still useful for modelling a
possible final state. Another approach is to assume that weathering is
proportional to the exposure to precipitation. Figure X shows an example
where the intensity of the dose map (max intensity is shown as white) is
proportional to the exposure to precipitation where precipitation has
been modelled through computational fluid dynamics.</p>
<h2 id="id5b">Measurements</h2>
<p>The material database is based on an experiment where 120 different
materials were exposed outdoors over a period of two years. The
measurements include a series of monthly digital images taken outside
during the natural weathering experiment. More information on the
experimental setup can be found in the literature<a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="id6b">Algorithm</h2>
<p>The images were post-processed to correct for variations in lightning
among other factors. Bands of latewood and earlywood, respectively, were
then identified. The exact algorithm is yet to be disclosed as part of a
scientific publication; however, the output includes the temporal
variations of colour as monthly RGB-values for latewood and earlywood,
respectively. As such, every species is represented by a 24x6 array.
This array can then be interpolated in two dimensions to get a
continuous function where the colour is described by the duration of
weathering and the ratio of latewood/earlywood.</p>
<p><img src="./image13.png"
style="width:3.48052in;height:1.81581in" /></p>
<p>Figure 10. Interpolated function describing the color change over
time of one species.</p>
<h2 id="id3b">Module input</h2>
<p>Figure 6 shows, conceptually, the process for visualizing weathering
from a 3D-model (geometry and UV-map), dosemap, texture map, and
species-specific RGB-curves. In short, the colours are mapped to the
geometry by taking the pixel intensity from the dosemap (0-1), finding
the corresponding RGB-values of latewood and earlywood, respectively,
and then mixing the two colors with weights based on the pixel intensity
of the wood texture map (0-1). It should be noted that the kinetics
derived from the database are related to the exposure conditions at the
site where the experiment was conducted. The rate of discoloration
should thus be scaled before application under different weather
conditions. However, this process involves the use of a dose model,
which is still under development.</p>
<p>In the CLICKdesign web-based tool, the model and wood texture are
included in binary format (.glb). The dose map is stored as an image,
either .png or .jpg. The database is stored in JSON-format.</p>
