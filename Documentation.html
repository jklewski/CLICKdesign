<p>Figure 1.</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows the concept used to simulate appearance changes of
wood caused by environmental effects. The kinetic and/or intensity of
such changes depends on structure and architectural design (3D model),
location (weather), microclimate (environmental analysis), and the
materials used for construction (measurements and database). The
relationship linking the various factors to kinetics is the dose model.
The dose model returns the degree of discoloration in different nodes on
the building envelope and the material database holds species-specific
relationships between colour and degree of discoloration.</p>
<p>In this section, Blender will be used to demonstrate the basic
components and procedures involved in deriving a dose map from a
geometry and environmental analysis. Blender is an open-source software
for 3D modelling. Some of the basic features include rendering, creating
objects, materials, animations, and scripting. For the sake of this
report, we will focus on a subset of general functions, including the
general components like the objects, materials, texture-mapping. In
addition, we will use some Blender-specific concepts such as particle
effects, dynamic paint and animations which can be used for
environmental analysis in lieu of more advanced computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) simulations. In cases where accuracy is important, then
it is recommended to perform the environmental analysis in a software
dedicated to numerical simulation and computational fluid dynamics.</p>
<h2 id="d-model">3D model</h2>
<p>Geometry is information describing the position of vertices and how
they connect to form lines and faces and objects. A vertex is a single
point in space, defined by its x, y and z-coordinate. Two vertices can
be joined to a line, and a minimum of three lines can be joined to a
face (surface). An object can consist of multiple surfaces. For example,
a box is made up of 8 vertices, 12 lines and 6 faces. A 3D model can
include multiple objects. Figure 1a shows a basic 3d model.</p>
<p>The material determine how object surfaces will be rendered. Real
materials are often visualized by projecting an image of a real material
onto the surface of the object. To project a flat image to an object
consisting of several surfaces facing in different directions (normal),
then the object needs to be unwrapped, or unfolded, onto a 2D plane.
This process is called <a
href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/uv/introduction.html">UV-mapping</a>.
Figure 1b shows the unwrapped surfaces of the basic 3D model. A flat
texture can then be mapped to match the UV-map, whereafter the 3D-shape
is reassembled.</p>

style="width:6.3in;height:1.91042in" /></h3>
<p>Figure 2. A basic 3D geometry (left) with its wall-surfaces unwrapped
onto a flat surface (right).</p>
<p>As an alternative to image textures, procedural material textures can
be generated from algorithms. Like vector-based graphics, procedural
textures are defined by mathematics and the resolution is only limited
by the resulting rendered image. Procedural textures are difficult to
transfer between different computer software. To solve this, a
procedural texture can be pre-rendered and mapped from the object onto a
2D texture image prior to transfer. Figure 2a shows a 3D model with
grayscale procedural textures and Figure 2b shows the same textures
rendered as a texture image. After pre-rendering, the object can easily
be reassembled in a different software from its geometry, the rendered
image, and the texture coordinates. The infinite resolution of the
procedural texture is however lost in the process.</p>

<h2 id="environmental-analysis">Environmental analysis</h2>
<p>Weather variables contributing to surface deterioration, mainly
wind-driven rain and direct solar radiation, should be simulated in an
environmental analysis and mapped a to an image which can then be
processed and projected onto the 3D-model. In the CLICKdesign project,
several different approaches have been used for environmental analysis.
In cases where accuracy is important it is recommended to perform the
environmental analysis in a software dedicated to numerical simulation
and computational fluid dynamics. However, reduced computational time
can be obtained by modelling precipitation through raytracing or
particle simulations. Figure 3 shows a particle simulation based on the
Blender native physics engine and the corresponding map showing the
exposed surfaces of the building.</p>

<h2 id="dose-model">Dose model</h2>
<p>The results from the environmental analysis are used as input to a
dose model to estimate the degree of discoloration in different nodes on
the building envelope. The model used to translate precipitation,
radiation and other effects to deterioration is called a dose model.
Unfortunately, a working dose model is yet to be developed. Therefore, a
CLICKdesign has used various simple criteria in lieu of an actual dose
model. For a simplified analysis, it can be assumed that any surface
which is exposed to both precipitation and solar radiation eventually
becomes fully weathered. This does not take into consideration the
kinetics of the degradation process but is still useful for modelling a
possible final state. Another approach is to assume that weathering is
proportional to the exposure to precipitation. Figure X shows an example
where the intensity of the dose map (max intensity is shown as white) is
proportional to the exposure to precipitation where precipitation has
been modelled through computational fluid dynamics.</p>
<h2 id="measurements">Measurements</h2>
<p>The material database is based on an experiment where 120 different
materials were exposed outdoors over a period of two years. The
measurements include a series of monthly digital images taken outside
during the natural weathering experiment. More information on the
experimental setup can be found in the literature<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="model">Model</h2>
<p>The images were post-processed to correct for variations in lightning
among other factors. Bands of latewood and earlywood, respectively, were
then identified. The exact algorithm is yet to be disclosed as part of a
scientific publication; however, the output includes the temporal
variations of colour as monthly RGB-values for latewood and earlywood,
respectively. As such, every species is represented by a 24x6 array.
This array can then be interpolated in two dimensions to get a
continuous function where the colour is described by the duration of
weathering and the ratio of latewood/earlywood.</p>

of one species.</p>
<h2 id="module-input">Module input</h2>
<p>Figure 6 shows, conceptually, the process for visualizing weathering
from a 3D-model (geometry and UV-map), dosemap, texture map, and
species-specific RGB-curves. In short, the colours are mapped to the
geometry by taking the pixel intensity from the dosemap (0-1), finding
the corresponding RGB-values of latewood and earlywood, respectively,
and then mixing the two colors with weights based on the pixel intensity
of the wood texture map (0-1). It should be noted that the kinetics
derived from the database are related to the exposure conditions at the
site where the experiment was conducted. The rate of discoloration
should thus be scaled before application under different weather
conditions. However, this process involves the use of a dose model,
which is still under development.</p>
<p>In the CLICKdesign web-based tool, the model and wood texture are
included in binary format (.glb). The dose map is stored as an image,
either .png or .jpg. The database is stored in JSON-format.</p>
